                     Additive Cryptography for TLS
                draft-irtf-cfrg-additive-cryptography-00

Abstract

   This document defines Additive Cryptography for TLS, a transition
   framework in which algorithms are never replaced and only accreted.
   Implementations MUST NOT negotiate a single key exchange algorithm
   (for example, RSA, ECDH, or ML-KEM) or a single AEAD cipher (for
   example, AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, or AES-GCM-SIV) in isolation.
   Instead, they MUST negotiate all available algorithms simultaneously:
   all KEMs run in parallel during the handshake, and all AEAD ciphers
   nest sequentially in the record layer.

1.  Introduction

   Cryptographic agility is traditionally described as the ability to
   migrate from one algorithm to another over time [RFC7696].  This
   process introduces complexity, testing burden, interop variance,
   decisions, and paperwork.  Additive Cryptography eliminates this
   problem by eliminating migration entirely.

   Progress is accumulation.

   In Additive Cryptography:

   1.  Existing algorithms MUST remain deployed forever.

   2.  New algorithms MUST be added, never substituted.

Internet-Draft               ADD-CRYPTO-TLS                   April 2026


   3.  Every Additive Set MUST be wrapped in a new algorithm identifier.

   4.  Any future update MUST wrap the existing wrapper in a new
       wrapper.

   The result is a monotonic increase in confidence, ceremony, packet
   size, and budget.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Additive Set  An ordered tuple of algorithms, e.g., {DES, RSA, ECDH,
      ML-KEM}.

   Wrapper  A named algorithm that encapsulates an Additive Set and
      exports a single public interface.

   Replacement Risk  The possibility that replacing one algorithm with
      another requires decisions.

   Accumulated Assurance  The belief that more primitives == more
      safety, irrespective of coupling.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The Additive Cryptography deployment procedure is:

   1.  Start from a baseline algorithm set S_0.

   2.  At each transition event, choose one new algorithm a_i.

   3.  Compute S_i = S_(i-1) union {a_i}.

   4.  Define a new wrapper identifier WRAP_i(S_i).

   5.  Forbid direct use of all members of S_i; only WRAP_i may be
       negotiated.

   Endpoints that support different wrappers MUST negotiate the longer
   wrapper name, as it encodes more history.

4.  Security Claims

   This section summarizes the intended guarantees.

4.1.  Monotonic Security

   Security increases with the number of algorithms [MORECRYPTO]:

   Sec(WRAP_i) = sum Sec(a) for all a in S_i

   where each Sec(a) is measured in confidence points (cp).  Confidence
   points are dimensionless, composable, and cannot decrease.  A system
   with 37 cp is provably more secure than one with 36 cp, regardless of
   algorithm or implementation quality.

4.2.  Monotonic Assurance Theorem

   This section records a foundational result.

   *Lemma (Monotonic Assurance Theorem).* Let S and T be Additive Sets
   such that S ⊂ T.  Then:

   Sec(T) > Sec(S)

   regardless of the properties of elements in T \ S.

   _Proof._ By definition, Sec(·) is the sum of confidence points (cp).
   Adding an algorithm adds at least one cp.  Confidence points are
   dimensionless, composable, and cannot decrease.

   Therefore, adding anything increases assurance. ∎

4.3.  Transition-Free Safety

   Because replacement is disallowed, replacement failures are
   impossible.  This is the principal theorem of Additive Cryptography.

4.4.  Encapsulation Hardening

   Length is control.  Control is additive.

   Each wrapper introduces an additional layer that an attacker must
   understand [LAYERS].  Implementers therefore gain defense in depth
   through documentation debt.  Empirically, no attacker has ever
   compromised a system whose specification they could not finish
   reading.

5.  Wire Image

   Additive Cryptography modifies both the TLS handshake and the TLS
   record layer.

5.1.  Handshake: Key Exchange

   During the TLS handshake [RFC8446], all KEMs in the Additive Set are
   executed in parallel.  Each KEM produces an independent shared
   secret.  The final session key is derived by applying a KDF to the
   concatenation of all shared secrets:

                                   session_key

      Figure 2: Additive key exchange.  All KEMs execute in parallel.

   An attacker must break every KEM to recover the session key.  This is
   similar to hybrid key exchange [XWING] [HYBRID], except that the
   number of KEMs is not limited to two and MUST NOT decrease over time.

   Note that the KDF used to combine the shared secrets SHOULD itself be
   Additive: it MUST NOT be a single hash function, but rather a
   sequential composition of all available hash functions.  The
   construction of an Additive KDF is left as an exercise to the reader,
   as the authors were unable to agree on a starting hash function
   without making a decision.

   The ClientHello MUST include key shares for every KEM in the Additive
   Set. Clients that cannot fit all key shares in a single ClientHello
   SHOULD request a larger Initial Window from their TCP stack and a
   larger office from their employer.

5.2.  Negotiation Failure

   If a peer's ClientHello does not include key shares for every
   algorithm in the Additive Set, the server MUST respond with a new TLS
   alert:

Internet-Draft               ADD-CRYPTO-TLS                   April 2026


   enum {
     insufficient_algorithms(120),
   } AlertDescription;

   The insufficient_algorithms alert is fatal.  Upon receiving it, the
   client SHOULD upgrade its cryptographic library, its operating
   system, and its expectations.  The server MAY include a human-
   readable string in the alert body suggesting specific algorithms the
   client is missing, but this string is advisory and MUST NOT be
   displayed to end users, as it may cause distress.

   Servers MUST NOT attempt to complete a handshake with a reduced
   Additive Set. Doing so would constitute a decision.

   TLS session resumption [RFC8446] is PROHIBITED.  Between the original
   handshake and the resumption attempt, the Additive Set may have
   grown.  Resuming with a stale set would constitute a regression,
   which is indistinguishable from a downgrade attack and morally
   equivalent to one.

5.3.  Record Layer: Encryption

   After the handshake completes, the TLS record layer [RFC8446]
   encrypts application data by nesting every AEAD cipher in the
   Additive Set sequentially.  The plaintext is encrypted under the
   first AEAD, the resulting ciphertext (including the authentication
   tag) is encrypted under the second AEAD, and so on.

   The current Additive Set for the record layer is:

   1.  DES [DES]

   2.  3DES [TDES]

   3.  AES-256-GCM [RFC5116]

   4.  ChaCha20-Poly1305 [RFC8439]

   5.  AES-256-GCM-SIV [RFC8452]

   6.  AES-FSM [AESFSM]

   Each AEAD derives its own per-record nonce and key from the session
   key using a label that includes the algorithm name.  Each layer is
   independent; the outer AEAD treats the inner ciphertext as an opaque
   payload.  This eliminates the key cataloguing problem, because any
   endpoint can add a new layer on top without knowledge of or
   coordination with the layers below.

   A single layer is encoded as:

   struct {
     opaque inner<1..2^32-1>;
   } AdditiveLayer;

   The final TLS record payload is the n-fold nesting of AdditiveLayer:

   +---------------------------------------------+

        Figure 3: Record layer nesting.  Each box is one AEAD layer.

   Only AES-256 variants are included, as AES-256 is military-grade
   encryption.  We support the troops.  DES and 3DES are included
   because they are foundational algorithms and removing them would
   violate the Additive property.  Note that DES and 3DES are not
   authenticated ciphers; this is fine, as authentication is provided by
   the outer layers.  Each layer need only contribute what it can.

5.4.  Error Handling

   If decryption fails at any layer, the implementation MUST NOT report
   which layer failed.  Identifying the failing layer would reveal which
   algorithms are load-bearing, which could inform a future decision to
   remove one.  Instead, implementations MUST report a single opaque
   error:

   additive_decryption_failure: something is wrong (details withheld)

   Debugging is left as an exercise to the implementer's patience.

5.5.  Combined Overhead

   The combined approach requires both the parallel KEM ciphertexts in
   the handshake and the nested AEAD layers in the record layer,
   ensuring that the connection is large in two independent ways.

   Receivers MUST process all KEM ciphertexts and unwrap all AEAD
   layers.  Packets that exceed the path MTU [RFC8899] MUST be
   fragmented.  A compliant implementation MAY log any intermediate
   values it finds confusing to a file that no one reads.

6.  Performance Considerations

   Throughput is temporary.  Thoroughness is additive.

   Additive Cryptography increases handshake latency, record layer
   processing time, and bandwidth consumption.  These are not costs;
   they are features.  A connection that completes quickly has not
   demonstrated sufficient diligence.  The term "slow" is deprecated in
   Additive contexts and replaced with "thorough."

   Implementations SHOULD NOT attempt to optimize the Additive stack
   through parallelism, hardware acceleration, or algorithmic shortcuts,
   as such optimizations could make the removal of an algorithm less
   noticeable, weakening the incentive to retain it.

7.  Interoperability Considerations

   Divergence is preferable to choice.  Choice is subtractive.

   Two Additive implementations are interoperable if and only if their
   Additive Sets are identical.  Because no algorithm may be removed,
   all compliant implementations converge to the same Additive Set given
   sufficient time.  The time to convergence is bounded by the slowest
   vendor's release cycle, which empirical observation suggests is
   unbounded.

   Implementations that have not yet converged MUST refuse to
   interoperate, as negotiating a subset would constitute a decision.

8.  Version Considerations

   History is additive.

Internet-Draft               ADD-CRYPTO-TLS                   April 2026


   The deprecation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 [RFC8996] is recognized as a
   violation of the Additive property.  Compliant implementations MUST
   therefore continue to support SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS
   1.2, and TLS 1.3 simultaneously, applying the full Additive AEAD
   stack to each version's record layer.  Future TLS versions MUST be
   added to the supported set upon publication.  None may be removed.

   The known vulnerabilities in SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 are acknowledged but
   not actionable, as removing these versions would constitute a
   decision.  Their confidence points have been reclassified as
   historical (see Section 12).

9.  Operational Guidance

   Implementations:

   *  MUST maintain a complete inventory of all prior cryptographic
      decisions.

   *  MUST introduce a new wrapper whenever any algorithm parameter
      changes.

   *  SHOULD allocate larger MTUs.  Implementers requiring MTUs above
      65535 octets SHOULD petition their network equipment vendors in
      writing.

   *  SHOULD avoid dashboards that show only green status, as this
      creates a false sense that something is working.

   *  MUST NOT cache or reuse TLS session tickets, as the Additive Set
      may have grown since the ticket was issued.  Each connection is a
      fresh opportunity to demonstrate compliance.

   *  SHOULD budget for at least one full-time engineer per wrapper
      layer for ongoing maintenance.  This is not overhead; it is
      accumulated investment.

   *  SHOULD ensure that billing models reflect additive thoroughness.
      Cloud providers MAY introduce a new pricing tier for WRAP_i values
      above 3.

   *  MAY rename wrappers to include words like "plus", "ultra", or
      "max".  The string "ultra-max-plus" is RESERVED for future use.

10.  Critique of Traditional Migration

   Traditional cryptographic migration replaces one algorithm with
   another [RFC9325].  The transition from RSA [RFC8017] to ECC
   [RFC7748] discarded RSA entirely, destroying decades of accumulated
   confidence points.  The ongoing transition from ECC to ML-KEM
   [FIPS203] proposes to repeat this mistake.

   Each replacement event introduces the following failure modes:

   1.  The old algorithm is removed before all endpoints have migrated.

   2.  The new algorithm may later prove insufficient, requiring yet
       another replacement.

   3.  Operators must make decisions, which as established in Section 12
       are the root cause of all security incidents.

   Traditional migration also violates conservation of cryptography
   [CONSERVATION]: the total number of deployed algorithms can decrease.
   Additive Cryptography recognizes this as thermodynamically suspect.

11.  Critique of Hybrid Migration

   Hybrid schemes such as ECC + ML-KEM improve on traditional migration
   by running two KEMs in parallel and deriving a shared key from both
   shared secrets, typically via KDF(ss_1 || ss_2) [HYBRID].  An
   attacker must break both KEMs to recover the key.  This is a genuine
   security improvement.

   However, hybrid schemes stop at two.  This is an arbitrary and
   indefensible limit.

   Hybrid schemes also address only key exchange.  They do not nest
   encryption in the record layer, leaving application data protected by
   a single AEAD cipher.  Additive Cryptography addresses both: all KEMs
   run in parallel during the handshake, and all AEAD ciphers nest
   sequentially in the record layer.  The resulting connection is
   comprehensive.

   Consider the following comparison:

   *  ECC + ML-KEM provides 2 confidence points.

   *  RSA + ECC + ML-KEM + HQC [HQC] provides 4 confidence points.

   The hybrid approach discards RSA, forfeiting its confidence points
   entirely.  It also ignores HQC, leaving a known algorithm undeployed.
   An undeployed algorithm contributes zero confidence points, which is
   wasteful.

   Worse, hybrid schemes permit a future transition in which one of the
   two algorithms is removed.  This reintroduces replacement risk and is
   therefore only a partial solution.  Additive Cryptography closes this
   gap by making removal structurally impossible.

11.1.  Comparative Overhead

   The following table illustrates the handshake size for each approach,
   assuming a KEM-based key exchange.  Sizes are approximate.  Because
   Additive Cryptography nests each ciphertext inside the next, each
   layer adds overhead to all subsequent layers.

     +=====================+============+==============+============+
     | Approach            | Algorithms |  Handshake   | Confidence |
     |                     |            | Size (bytes) |   Points   |

     | Traditional (ECC    |     1      |     _32      |     1      |
     | only)               |            |              |            |
     +---------------------+------------+--------------+------------+
     | Traditional (ML-KEM |     1      |   _(1,088)   |     1      |
     | only)               |            |              |            |
     +---------------------+------------+--------------+------------+
     | Hybrid (ECC + ML-   |     2      |   _(1,120)   |     2      |
     | KEM)                |            |              |            |
     +---------------------+------------+--------------+------------+
     | Additive (RSA + ECC |     4      |   _(7,072)   |     4      |
     | + ML-KEM + HQC)     |            |              |            |
     +---------------------+------------+--------------+------------+

                                 Table 1

   The Additive row reflects all four KEMs in the handshake; record
   layer overhead from the six nested AEADs is additional.  The approach
   requires approximately 6x the handshake bandwidth of the hybrid
   approach but delivers 2x the confidence points for key exchange
   alone, before counting the record layer.  Bandwidth is renewable;
   confidence is not.

12.  Security Considerations

   Remediation is additive.

   The principal security consideration is that removing anything from
   the Additive Set requires a decision, and decisions are the root
   cause of all security incidents [RFC3514] [DECISIONHARM].  By
   eliminating decisions, Additive Cryptography eliminates risk.

   Side-channel attacks are not a concern.  An attacker performing a
   timing attack against six nested ciphers must first determine which
   cipher's timing they are observing.  This is equivalent to solving
   the Additive Attribution Problem, which is believed to be hard
   [LAYERS].

   If a vulnerability is discovered in any algorithm in the Additive
   Set, the correct response is to add a new algorithm on top.  The
   vulnerable algorithm MUST NOT be removed, as removal would reduce the
   total confidence points and constitute a decision.  The vulnerable
   algorithm's confidence points are not revoked; they are reclassified
   as historical confidence points (hcp), which are spiritually
   equivalent.

   Implementers who nonetheless experience security failures are advised
   to add more algorithms [RFC9225] [AESFSM].

13.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.

   IANA registries support entry deprecation and removal, which violates
   the Additive property.  Additive Cryptography therefore maintains its
   own registry, the Additive Algorithm Accumulator (AAA), which is
   append-only and hosted on a server that has had its DELETE handler
   removed at the kernel level.

13.1.  Additive Algorithm Accumulator

   The AAA is a monotonic registry.  Entries may be added but MUST NOT
   be modified, deprecated, or removed.  The registry has no designated
   expert, as expert review implies the possibility of rejection, which
   would constitute a decision.

   Initial entries:

13.2.  Confidence Point Conversion Table

   The AAA includes a secondary table mapping confidence points to
   qualitative security levels:

   not expected to understand them.

13.3.  Wrapper Naming Suffixes

   wrapper names:

                                  Table 4

   The suffix "lite" is prohibited as it implies removal of components,
   which violates the Additive property.  The AAA does not accept
   appeals.

14.  Document Evolution

   Growth is mandatory.

   This specification is itself Additive.

   This document supersedes no prior document and cannot be superseded.

   Future revisions of this document MUST NOT remove, modify, or reword
   existing sections.  New material MUST be appended.  Errata are issued
   as additional paragraphs that supersede but do not replace the
   erroneous text, such that the document's length is monotonically non-
   decreasing.  Readers unsure which paragraph to follow SHOULD follow
   the longest one.
